  hosts: all # Or specify a target group like 'webservers', 'management'
  become: true # Required for package installation, service management, firewall rules

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Cockpit package is installed

        name: cockpit
        state: present       # Ensures the package is installed
        update_cache: yes    # Good practice to update cache before installing

    - name: Enable and start Cockpit socket
      ansible.builtin.systemd:
        name: cockpit.socket # Cockpit listens via socket activation
        enabled: yes         # Ensure it starts on boot (equivalent to systemctl enable)
        state: started       # Ensure it's running now (equivalent to systemctl start)

    # Note: This task requires the ansible.posix collection

    - name: Allow Cockpit service through firewalld
      ansible.posix.firewalld:
        service: cockpit     # The predefined cockpit service name
        permanent: yes       # Make the rule persistent (like --permanent)
        state: enabled       # Ensure the rule exists and is active (like --add-service)
        immediate: yes       # Apply the rule to the running configuration immediately (like the non-permanent --add-service)
      # This single task replaces the two firewall-cmd commands and the need for a separate reload/restart.
      # It ensures the service is allowed both persistently and in the current runtime configuration.
